For example, they blame Vivendo for suspected food poisoning. The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations. The new head of the legal department wants to see if there are differences in the time it takes to close claims across the locations.\n### Tool used for analysis and creating visualizations : TABLEAU\n\nTo view the interactive dashboard [Click Here!](https://public.tableau.com/views/DatacampCertification/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) ","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"a5b3bc0e-b993-4ee3-bd07-825a474bd0d9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Table of Contents\n1.

Thus, these columns were unchanged since all values were as expected in the data dictionary. \n\nThe detailed changes made for rest of the 4 columns to enable further analysis is given below:\n\n* **Column 2: Time to Close**:\t\n\t- There were no NULL Values. But, unexpected value: -57 seen corresponding to the Claim ID → 0000000-00.2019.0.00.0079  \n\t- Action performed: Since this column records no. of days, it cant be a negative value. So, assumed -57 value to be an error while recording. Thus, converted -57 to +57 by creating new calculated field (Time_to_close_modified) with the formula: \n \t\t  \t<p>\t IF [Time to Close]<0 <br>\n \t \t    THEN [Time to Close]*-1 <br>\n\t\t\t\t\tELSE [Time to Close] <br>\n\t\t\t\t\tEND</p>\n      \t      \n* **Column 3: Claim Amount**:\n\t- There were no NULL Values. But, data type of column is incorrect. For example, \"R\\$50,000.00\" should be converted into 50000. So, splitted the value at second position to remove \"R$\" from the values, trimmed off extra spaces and converted it into integer. \n    - Created new calculated field (Claim Amount - Modified) with the following formula: \n \t    <p> INT(TRIM( SPLIT( [Claim Amount], \"R$\", 2 ) )) </p>\n     \n* **Column 6: Individuals on Claim**:\n\t- Unexpected value seen: 7 zero valued rows.\n    - I inferred these 7 zero valued rows could be an error while recording from further analysis into other corresponding columns.

Data Discovery and Visualization\n### (i) How does the number of claims differ across locations?\n* The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations - “RECIFE”, “SAO LUIS”, “FORTALEZA”,“NATAL”. First I am checking number of claims across locations.\n* **Inference from graph below:** The highest claims received is in \"Sao Luis\" and lowest in \"Natal\". So, need to dive deeper into criteria of how data is distributed across different location and find any relation with other fields.\n![Number of claims Vs Locations](Count_vs_location.png)\n\n   \n### (ii) What is the distribution of time to close claims?\n* Now, looking into how the distribution of time to close claims across overall locations.\n* **Inference from graph below::** The distribution of time to close claims is not uniform. The highest no. of claims closed is between 400-600 days and very few (around 4) cases takes longer than 2400 days.\n![Distribution of Time to close claims overall location](distribution_across_location.png)\n\n* To get more insights about distribution of time to close claims across overall locations used a box plot.\n* **Inference from graph below::** We understand that 50 percentage of total claims are getting closed before 638 days and 75 percentage of total claims are closed before 1143 days. So, need to check each locations contribution towards this.\n![Distribution of Time to close claims box plot](distribution_box_plot.png)\n\n* Finding how the distribution of time to close claims differ in each location.\n* **Inference from graph below::** We can see \"Sao Luis\" has the highest no. of days to close 50 percentage and 75 percentage of claims compared to other locations. So, need to check any factor affecting this.\n![Distribution of Time to close claims for each location](each_location_distribution.png)\n\n### (iii) How does the average time to close claims differ by location?\n* Finding how does the average time to close claims differ by location\n* **Inference from graph below::** The average time to close claims is highest in location - Sao Luis. It might be because the number of claim is the highest in Sao Luis. So, need to investigate more about it.\n![Average time to close claims Vs location](avg_time_location.png)\n### (iv) Checking if any relation in Avg. time to close claims and other measures\n* We sre analysing why Avg. Time to close is highest is Sao Luis by checking its relation with other measures.\n* **Inference from graph and table below::** It seems as the count of claims increase the Avg. time to close also increases.But, we are unable to deduce a relationship between  Avg. time to close and other measures (Avg. Amount paid, Avg. Individuals on claim).\n![TIME_TO_CLOSE_VS_COUNT.png](TIME_TO_CLOSE_VS_COUNT.png)\n![Time_to_close_Vs_Amount_paid](Time_to_close_Vs_Amount_paid.png)\n","metadata":{},"id":"9ee1512b-4918-41a1-a1b8-61074f5ab54e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ Summary\n- The highest claims received is in \"Sao Luis\" and lowest in \"Natal\". \n- The distribution of time to close claims is not uniform.
